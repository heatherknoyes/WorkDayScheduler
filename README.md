# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a quiz game that helps the user practice their JavaScript knowledge. By using Web APIs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I was able to create a simple multi-screen game that the user can interact with. I learned how to create dynamic HTML elements with JavaScript in multiple screens while also using the users local storage in one instance of a game to keep a simple high score history. I also learned how to manipulate and handle user inputs to determine which screen should show next, how the timer and score is affected, and writing over initial HTML text to display different text dynamically as well. The thing I am most proud of with this project is that I was able to use my own design of screen switching to make elements appear and disappear without code reuse. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user acceptance criteria.

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

This project taught me how to use dynamic HTML building using Web APIs with JavaScript. In the future, I would try to incorporate a randomized selection of the questions. In addition, I would love to add better styling to the quiz to give feedback to the user for which questions they got right or which ones they missed. This would make the UX more appealing and intelligent than just a quiz and a score.

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Installation

1. Download all files within the main directory as well as the assets directory to your device.

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the website.

3. If future edits need to be made then the stylesheet can be found under ./assets/css/style.css. The JavaScript can be found under the ./assets/js/script.js.

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance in a gif:
